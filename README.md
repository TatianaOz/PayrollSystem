The code to be produced

You are supposed to write your program according to the given diagram. You should take the following into account: 

1.	Methods and Properties shown in the diagram MUST remain exactly as they are.
2.	You are free to add new methods (polymorphic or not) and/or properties to ANY class(es) 
3.	You must create an interface (IPrintable) containing one single method: 
3.1.	void printMyData() 
4.	Every class MUST adopt the IPrintable interface and return a printable version of their properties 
5.	You must add properties and/or methods to the Classes Car and Motorcycle (at least 2 properties per class). 
6.	You MUST use “Set” and/or “Get” to expose ONLY what needs to be exposed by each class (hint: all properties MUST be private and accessed only via Getter and Setter methods. 
7.	You must consider that classes Employee, Vehicle and PartTime are ABSTRACT classes 
8.	In order to test the output, you must create at least 2 objects of each non abstract class 
9.	You are free to design how your system will print each object’s data if every single data is printed out.
